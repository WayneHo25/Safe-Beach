# Safe-Beach
A charity website about beach safety in Victoria, a graduate project in Monash University

## Description
Our project is building a website for backpackers and international students who intend to visit the beaches without any knowledge of the beaches in Melbourne. This site offers a browsing facility for the beaches while providing the safety measures in place at the respective beaches such as patrol information, water quality, UV index, weather and drowning incidents.
