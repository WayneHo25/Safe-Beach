## Description
Our project is building a website for backpackers and international students who intend to visit the beaches without any knowledge of the beaches in Melbourne. This site offers a browsing facility for the beaches while providing the safety measures in place at the respective beaches such as patrol information, water quality, UV index, weather and drowning incidents.

A large number of swimmers go to beaches to enjoy the sunshine and cool sea water in Australia but most of them are not aware of the imminent dangers. As per Royal Life Saving Society – Australia (2016), 280 people drowned in Australian waterways while the top location is beaches. Drownings reach 10-year high in Australian and 83 percent of that number is men. 43 cases happened in Victoria. Drowning is not the only risk for swimmers in Victorian beaches. ABC News (2017) claims that beachgoers should keep a wary eye on bluebottle jellyfish in part of Victorian beaches in December 2016, which will be blown into the shallow waters and be allergic to very young and old people. Therefore, beach safety has been a great problem for the residents or tourists in Victoria. For avoiding more injury and death, it is a good idea to spread safety awareness for beaches to reduce drowning and other incidents.

The potential audience includes tourists and international students in Melbourne (age group 18-25 years) who are not familiar with this city and intend to go to beaches.

The users should be able to choose a beach by searching by location or from recommended beaches based on their geographical location along with the weather updates. They would be provided with safety information such as tide time, UV index, patrol availability， drowning incidents reports and time as well as weather forecasts to avoid any potential life threatening events. They can also get some advice about first-aid and location information for medical service nearby.

This is a web application which can be browsed on desktop and mobile phones as well as tablets. It is suitable for any system such as windows, Android and iOS. Users can scroll, select and input words using keyboard and mouse or touch-screen devices.
